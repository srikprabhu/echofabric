# echofabric - Let's Fabricate Echoes into Actionable Intelligence!

Got it — you want a **README.md** for a project called **EchoFabric**,  
which **listens to customer care voice recordings** → **extracts insights** → **outputs to CSV or dashboard**.

I'll create a clean, professional, GitHub-ready **README.md** for you.  
Here's the full content:

# 📣 EchoFabric

**AI-driven platform to listen, transcribe, and analyze customer care voice recordings — turning conversations into actionable insights.**  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**EchoFabric** automatically processes voice recordings from customer care calls, extracts valuable insights, and outputs them into structured formats like:
- 📄 CSV Reports
- 📊 Interactive Dashboards

It helps businesses:
- Understand customer pain points
- Track agent performance
- Identify trending topics and sentiments
- Improve service quality over time

---

## 📂 Features

- 🎙️ **Voice-to-Text Transcription** — Convert call recordings into text using Speech-to-Text AI.
- 📈 **Insight Extraction** — Analyze transcripts to detect:
  - Customer issues
  - Sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
  - Common keywords & topics
  - Call duration and emotional trends
- 📑 **CSV Export** — Save structured insights into easy-to-use `.csv` files.
- 📊 **Dashboard Visualization** — Generate beautiful dashboards for deeper analytics.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (backend processing)
- **Speech Recognition** (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper, or AWS Transcribe)
- **Natural Language Processing** (spaCy, NLTK, or HuggingFace Transformers)
- **Pandas** (for structured data output)
- **Plotly / Dash / Streamlit** (for dashboard visualizations)
- **Optional:** Docker, Azure Blob Storage / AWS S3 (for large recording storage)

---

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Input:** Upload customer call audio files (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`).
2. **Processing:**
   - Automatic speech-to-text conversion
   - Text cleansing and segmentation
   - Sentiment analysis and keyword extraction
3. **Output:**
   - Save insights into a CSV file
   - Display interactive charts on a dashboard (optional)

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/echofabric.git
cd echofabric
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional:
- Install `ffmpeg` if audio needs preprocessing.
- Set up API keys for cloud speech recognition services (if required).

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```python
from echofabric.processor import EchoProcessor

# Initialize processor
processor = EchoProcessor()

# Process audio file
insights = processor.process_audio('calls/customer_call_001.wav')

# Export to CSV
processor.export_to_csv(insights, 'outputs/customer_call_001.csv')

# Visualize
processor.visualize_insights(insights)
```

---

## 📈 Example Insight Fields in CSV

| Call ID | Customer Sentiment | Top Keywords      | Call Duration | Issues Detected         |
|-------- |--------------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 001     | Negative            | "billing, refund" | 5 mins 23 sec | Billing Error, Refund Request |

---

## 🛡️ Security and Privacy

- All audio files and transcriptions are processed **locally** or securely via encrypted cloud APIs.
- No data is shared without explicit permission.

---

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- Multi-language voice processing
- Real-time transcription and insight generation
- Integration with CRM tools (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Predictive modeling for churn risk detection
